## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I made use of the Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

I have explored here the 2017 Stack Overflow results in order to obtain some information on software developers like the importance of the job industry to be assessed while applying, what developers would require when they share an office and which development environment has been used regularly. There will be three questions I will seek to answer in order to get this information:
1. If two developers are sharing an office, is it okay for one of them to get a mechnical keyboard with loud "Clicky" keys?
2. Which development environment(s) do we use regularly?
3. When you're assessing potential jobs to apply to, how important are each of the following to you? The languages, frameworks, and other technologies I'd be working with?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
